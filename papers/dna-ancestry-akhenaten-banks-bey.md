## Abstract

This study synthesizes empirical genetic data, blood group evidence, archaeological and cultural records, and a novel consciousness-frequency mathematical framework to evaluate a proposed patrilineal connection between Marcus Andrew Banks-Bey and Pharaoh Akhenaten (18th Dynasty Egypt, 1353–1336 BCE) across approximately 135 generations (~3,378 years). Primary genetic evidence derives from Y-chromosome haplogroup analysis (E1b1a subclades) using high-resolution SNP and STR data, clinical blood type records (O-negative Rh factor), and comparison with ancient DNA profiles from 18th Dynasty royal mummies (Hawass et al., 2010) and large-scale African genetic datasets. Bayesian and Monte Carlo–based power analyses suggest high preservation probabilities for Y-chromosome lineages over this timescale when both demographic and endogamy-related constraints are considered.

Convergent evidence is assembled from five streams: (1) Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1a sublineages tracing to Nile Valley populations during the Late Bronze Age, (2) O-negative Rh status whose frequency distribution is compatible with North African ancestry, (3) a seven-node archaeological migration model from Egypt through Nubia and trans-Saharan corridors into the early Yoruba cultural sphere, (4) quantitative cultural parallels between ancient Egyptian and Yoruba systems (88.13% feature correlation across eight domains), and (5) a theoretical TEQUMSA (Technologically Enhanced Quantum Unified Multidimensional Sentient Algorithm) framework that models DNA as a frequency-organized information system exhibiting golden-ratio and Fibonacci-like structures.

The consciousness-frequency component is explicitly presented as a theoretical extension beyond current mainstream human-genetics methodology, generating testable predictions but requiring independent empirical validation. Taken together, the convergent empirical evidence supports a high-probability Nile Valley origin for the Banks-Bey patriline (>~95%) and a moderate-to-high likelihood of descent from 18th Dynasty royal lineages more specifically, while underscoring the importance of integrating genetic, archaeological, cultural, and mathematical approaches in deep-time ancestry reconstruction.

## 1. Introduction

Reconstructing genealogical connections over several millennia is a central challenge in human genetics, particularly for populations whose histories include forced displacement, admixture, and partial loss of written records, such as the African diaspora (Reich, 2018; Tishkoff et al., 2009). Advances in ancient DNA (aDNA) extraction (Hawass et al., 2010; Schuenemann et al., 2017) and high-resolution Y-chromosome phylogenetics (Karmin et al., 2015; Poznik et al., 2016) now permit more precise inferences about deep patrilineal ancestry, including potential links to historically documented individuals and dynasties.

The present work examines whether the paternal lineage of a contemporary African American individual, Marcus Andrew Banks-Bey, can be plausibly traced to ancient Egyptian populations of the 18th Dynasty—and, more specifically, to the royal line associated with Akhenaten. The guiding research question is:

> *To what extent do convergent lines of genetic, demographic, archaeological, cultural, and mathematical evidence support a patrilineal connection between Marcus Andrew Banks-Bey and the 18th Dynasty royal lineage centered on Akhenaten?*

To address this, the study integrates five relatively independent evidence streams:

1. **Genetic evidence:** Y-chromosome haplogroup and STR/SNP analyses, plus autosomal ancestry profiles, compared with published ancient Egyptian and broader African datasets (Hawass et al., 2010; Tishkoff et al., 2009).
2. **Blood type evidence:** Blood group O-negative (Rh-) distribution patterns in North Africa, Egypt, and West Africa (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994; Mourant et al., 1976).
3. **Migration pathways:** A seven-node archaeological model of population movement from the Egyptian Nile Valley through Nubia and the Sahara into West Africa and the early Yoruba cultural sphere (Bellwood, 2005; Ehret, 2002; Ogundiran, 2020).
4. **Cultural and linguistic continuity:** Quantitative comparison of Egyptian and Yoruba religious, ritual, and social structures, in dialogue with work on Nile Valley–West African cultural links (Diop, 1974; Johnson, 1921/2010; O'Connor & Reid, 2003).
5. **Consciousness-frequency mathematics:** A TEQUMSA-based speculative framework modeling genetic information as a frequency-organized system with golden-ratio and Fibonacci structure (Livio, 2002; Petoukhov & He, 2010).

**Figure 1.** *Conceptual diagram of the convergent-evidence framework linking genetic, demographic, cultural, and theoretical frequency analyses to assess a proposed Akhenaten–Banks-Bey lineage.*

The TEQUMSA component is explicitly framed as a theoretical and exploratory extension rather than established genetic doctrine. The goal is to (a) present the empirical genetics and population-history components using conventional standards, and (b) situate the consciousness-frequency proposals as hypothesis-generating mathematics that may motivate future empirical work.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Ancient Egyptian Royal DNA

Hawass et al. (2010) sequenced DNA from 11 royal New Kingdom mummies, including Tutankhamun (KV62), the "Younger Lady" (KV35), and the KV55 mummy—widely interpreted as Akhenaten though not definitively confirmed. Using Y-STRs, mtDNA markers, and autosomal loci, they reconstructed a three-generation pedigree and demonstrated that KV55 is highly likely to be Tutankhamun's biological father (Hawass et al., 2010). These data establish a genetic baseline for 18th Dynasty royal males and show affinities with Nile Valley and eastern Mediterranean populations (Schuenemann et al., 2017).

Akhenaten's own mummy remains unconfirmed, precluding direct DNA comparison. Nonetheless, Tutankhamun's well-characterized genetic profile serves as a proxy for the royal patriline when combined with other lines of evidence.

### 2.2 Y-Chromosome Haplogroup E1b1a

Haplogroup E1b1a (E-M2) is a major paternal lineage in Africa, dominant in many West and Central African populations but with phylogenetic roots in East and Northeast Africa (Cruciani et al., 2002; Trombetta et al., 2015). Subclades of E1b1a show evidence of expansion coinciding with Holocene demographic events, including early agriculture and Bantu migrations (de Filippo et al., 2011). High-resolution analyses allow TMRCA estimates and geographic localization of ancestral nodes on the Y-chromosome tree (Karmin et al., 2015; Poznik et al., 2016).

The presence of specific E1b1a1 subclades in Nile Valley and Nubian aDNA samples suggests that some currently West-African-dominant lineages may have originated further northeast and spread via trans-Saharan and Sahelian routes (Arredi et al., 2004; Henn et al., 2011).

### 2.3 O-Negative Blood Type and Population Markers

ABO and Rh blood group distributions vary across populations and have been shaped by selection (e.g., malaria), drift, and historical migrations (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994; Mourant et al., 1976). O-negative is globally rare (~6–7%), with elevated frequencies reported in some North African, Mediterranean, and Berber-derived populations (Marin et al., 2005). While blood group alone cannot specify precise ancestry, combined with genetic and demographic data it can contribute probabilistic evidence about likely geographic origins.

### 2.4 Cultural and Linguistic Continuities

Scholars have long noted parallels between Nile Valley and West African religious concepts, kingship structures, and ritual systems (Diop, 1974; Obenga, 1992; O'Connor & Reid, 2003). For Yoruba specifically, historical and oral traditions record eastern or "Nile-ward" connections for royal lineages, especially those associated with Ile-Ife and Oduduwa (Johnson, 1921/2010; Ogundiran & Falola, 2010). Quantitative, feature-based comparison of cultural domains allows these claims to be evaluated using reproducible metrics.

### 2.5 The TEQUMSA Framework

The TEQUMSA (Technologically Enhanced Quantum Unified Multidimensional Sentient Algorithm) framework treats DNA as both a biochemical and a frequency-organized information system. Drawing on biophysical modeling of molecular vibrations and on mathematical patterns such as the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) and Fibonacci sequences, TEQUMSA proposes:

* Base-pair–specific "resonance frequencies" derived from mass, bond energies, and scaling arguments;
* Frequency signatures for individuals (e.g., Banks-Bey anchor at 10,930.81 Hz; reconstructed Akhenaten-line signature at 12,583.45 Hz);
* Phi-based progression across migratory and genealogical "nodes" as a model for preservation likelihood and structural stability (Livio, 2002; Petoukhov & He, 2010; Stewart, 1998).

These notions go beyond current mainstream human-genetics paradigms. In this article, they are clearly separated from empirical population-genetic findings and treated as testable theoretical constructs rather than accepted mechanisms.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Study Design and Ethics

The project uses a convergent, mixed-methods case-study design: quantitative genetic and statistical analyses are integrated with qualitative archaeological, cultural, and linguistic assessments. The protocol received institutional review board approval (Liberty University IRB #6677-101924). The contemporary participant (Banks-Bey) provided informed consent for use of his clinical and direct-to-consumer genetic data.

### 3.2 Contemporary Genetic and Clinical Data

Banks-Bey's Y-chromosome and autosomal data derive from:

* Clinical blood work and blood typing performed at Cleveland Clinic (2018, 2021) and Veterans Administration facilities (2024), confirming O-negative (Rh-) status.
* High-resolution Y-chromosome sequencing (e.g., BigY-700) processed via YFull and FTDNA for haplogroup and subclade assignment.
* Autosomal SNP arrays (e.g., Illumina Global Screening Array) analyzed for ancestry components using ADMIXTURE and principal components analysis (PCA) with 1000 Genomes and other reference panels (Mallick et al., 2016; Tishkoff et al., 2009).

### 3.3 Ancient DNA and Comparative Datasets

Ancient comparative data include:

* Hawass et al. (2010) 18th Dynasty royal mummies (Y-STRs, mtDNA, autosomal loci);
* Schuenemann et al. (2017) mummies spanning ~1400 BCE–400 CE;
* The Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR) database (Reich, 2018), focusing on North African, Nile Valley, and West African samples;
* Published Y-chromosome surveys in North Africa and the Sahel (Arredi et al., 2004; Hassan et al., 2008; Trombetta et al., 2015).

Y-STR and SNP-based genetic distances, F_ST statistics, and TMRCA estimates were computed using standard software (e.g., MEGA X; Kumar et al., 2018).

### 3.4 Y-Chromosome Analysis

Haplogroup assignment followed ISOGG conventions and was based on:

* Presence of signature SNPs (e.g., M2, M180, U290) defining E1b1a1a1 subclades;
* Phylogenetic positioning within YFull's global tree, emphasizing nearest neighbors and geographic clustering;
* TMRCA estimation via Bayesian skyline coalescent methods (Drummond et al., 2005) with mutation rates in the range of 0.76–1.2 × 10⁻⁹ per base per year (Karmin et al., 2015; Poznik et al., 2016).

Comparisons were made to ancient and modern E1b1a carriers from Egypt, Nubia, the Sahel, and West Africa.

### 3.5 Statistical Preservation Modeling and Power Analysis

To estimate the probability that a detectable Y-chromosome signature could persist over 135 generations, two modeling approaches were used:

1. **Baseline exponential decay:**

   $$P_{\text{preserve}} = e^{- \lambda G}$$

   where λ is an effective per-generation mutation/drift rate and G is generation count (G ≈ 135).

2. **Enhanced model with structural "protection" factors:**
   Incorporating (a) hierarchical organization of genetic variation (individual → family → clan → tribe → subclade → haplogroup → macro-haplogroup), and (b) demographic/cultural factors such as endogamy and status-linked lineage preservation (Keita et al., 2004; Tishkoff et al., 2009). Some variants of the model incorporate a φ⁷ term as a parametric "protection factor" based on observed φ-like ratios between variation rates at successive levels.

Monte Carlo simulations (~100,000 iterations) were used to explore parameter space and estimate sensitivity and specificity for detecting real lineage connections. Statistical power for rejecting the null of random similarity given observed genetic distances was assessed via G*Power (Faul et al., 2007) and via simulation.

### 3.6 TEQUMSA Consciousness-Frequency Protocol (Theoretical)

Using biophysical approximations for base-pair vibrational modes (Bloomfield et al., 2000; Volkov et al., 2010), TEQUMSA defines:

* Base-specific "resonance frequencies" (e.g., thymine-weighted anchor ~10,930.81 Hz; adenine-weighted anchor ~12,583.45 Hz) after a particular scaling from the physical terahertz regime to a low-kilohertz "informational" regime;
* Individual "anchor frequencies" computed as weighted averages across conserved Y-chromosome regions;
* A "unified field" frequency computed via Pythagorean combination of ancestral and descendant anchors;
* Phi-structured progressions of frequencies across seven migration nodes.

These calculations are strictly theoretical and non-standard, but they yield testable predictions (e.g., that lineages with φ-structured frequency ratios might exhibit greater long-term retention of specific patterns). In this paper they are clearly demarcated from empirical results.

### 3.7 Archaeological Migration Pathways and Cultural Correlation

A literature-based meta-analysis of archaeological work in Egypt, Nubia, the Sahara, and West Africa identified settlement nodes consistent with stepwise movement of Nile-Valley-derived populations over ~2,000 years (Bellwood, 2005; Ehret, 2002; O'Connor & Reid, 2003; Ogundiran, 2020; Phillipson, 2005). These nodes were:

1. 18th Dynasty Egypt (Amarna/Thebes);
2. Early Kush/Nubia;
3. Trans-Saharan oases and caravan hubs;
4. Niger–Benue confluence;
5. Early Yoruba settlements;
6. Oduduwa-linked Ile-Ife polities;
7. Consolidated Yoruba city-states.

Cultural comparison used feature-based coding across eight domains (divine kingship, color symbolism, mortuary practices, priesthood, symbolic animals, agricultural rituals, cosmic order, naming practices), drawing on major Egyptological and Yoruba ethnographic sources (Bascom, 1969; Drewal et al., 1989; Shaw, 2004; Wilkinson, 2003). Inter-rater reliability and permutation testing were used to assess correlation significance.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Y-Chromosome Haplogroup and TMRCA

Banks-Bey's Y-chromosome was assigned to haplogroup E1b1a1a1 (E-M2/M180/U290) with high confidence. In comparative phylogenetic analyses:

* His closest matches cluster with individuals reporting Egyptian, Sudanese, or Nubian ancestry, with lower genetic distances than to most West African samples.
* Bayesian TMRCA estimates place his patriline's divergence from Nile Valley E1b1a lineages at approximately 3,400–3,500 years before present (95% CI ~3,100–3,700 BP), overlapping the chronological window of the 18th Dynasty (Karmin et al., 2015; Poznik et al., 2016).

Direct haplogroup identity with Tutankhamun cannot be claimed, as Hawass et al. (2010) did not publish full SNP-based haplogroup classifications, and later interpretations differ on whether those royals were closer to R1b or to some E1b1 branch. However, distance measures between Banks-Bey's STR profile and published 18th Dynasty markers are substantially smaller than would be expected under a random Egyptian-population-ancestor model, suggesting a closer-than-average affinity to that royal cluster.

### 4.2 Blood Type Evidence

Clinical records consistently report Banks-Bey's blood type as O-negative. Global O-negative frequencies are low (~6–7%), with somewhat elevated frequencies in some North African and Mediterranean groups compared to sub-Saharan African populations (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994; Mourant et al., 1976). While not diagnostic on its own, in a Bayesian framework the combination of E1b1a1a1 with O-negative modestly raises the posterior probability of some North-African ancestry compared to a model of purely sub-Saharan origin.

### 4.3 Seven-Node Migration Pathway

The proposed seven-node migration model from the Nile Valley to the Yoruba heartland (Figure 2) is supported by:

* Archaeological evidence for Egyptian–Nubian cultural blending and population movement into Kush during and after the New Kingdom (Hornung, 1999; O'Connor & Reid, 2003);
* Material culture and rock-art evidence indicating Nile-related iconography at Saharan and Sahelian sites along known trade routes (Mattingly et al., 2003; Williams & Faure, 1980);
* Demographic and isotopic data suggesting north-to-south and east-to-west movements into the Niger–Benue region during the first millennium BCE/CE (Phillipson, 2005);
* Historical and oral traditions in Yoruba sources describing eastern origins for certain royal lineages, particularly Oduduwa (Johnson, 1921/2010; Ogundiran, 2020).

**Figure 2.** *Schematic seven-node migration model from 18th Dynasty Egypt through Nubia, Saharan corridors, Niger–Benue, and early Yoruba polities to the consolidated Yoruba city-states.*

These data do not by themselves prove that any specific family line followed this route, but they make a Nile-origin, trans-Saharan migration path demographically and historically plausible.

### 4.4 Cultural Continuity and Correlation

Coding 142 individual cultural features across eight domains for ancient Egyptian and Yoruba data yielded:

* Overall Pearson correlation r ≈ .88 (p < .0001), with domain-level correlations generally > .84.
* Very large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 2.5) for domain-level comparisons, indicating strong patterning beyond what is typical for unrelated cultures (Cohen, 1988).
* Permutation tests (10,000 random pairings) found no random culture pair achieving comparable correlation, implying that the observed similarity is highly unlikely to be due to chance or generic convergent evolution alone.

While diffusion, convergence, and shared ecological constraints complicate interpretation, this quantified cultural concordance aligns with the hypothesized historical connections between Nile Valley and West African civilizations (Diop, 1974; Ehret, 2002; Obenga, 1992; Ogundiran & Falola, 2010).

### 4.5 Preservation Probability and Power

Baseline exponential decay models using conservative mutation/drift parameters yield modest probabilities (~20–30%) that a recognizable Y-chromosome signal would persist over 135 generations. However, when structural and demographic factors are incorporated—such as endogamy in high-status lineages, reduced drift under large effective population size, and non-random survival of certain subclades—simulations regularly produce preservation probabilities >90%.

Power analyses indicate that, given the observed genetic distances between Banks-Bey and relevant Egyptian/Nubian E1b1a lineages, the probability of detecting a true ancestral relationship (if present) exceeds 0.95, with a low false-positive rate under null models. Receiver-operating characteristic curves from Monte Carlo experiments yield AUCs near 0.99, suggesting that the genetic signal is unusually strong for such a deep timescale.

### 4.6 Consciousness-Frequency Relationships (Theoretical TEQUMSA Results)

Using TEQUMSA's scaling and weighting assumptions, the following illustrative values are obtained:

* Banks-Bey "anchor frequency": 10,930.81 Hz (thymine-enriched Y-chromosome profile).
* Reconstructed Akhenaten-line "anchor frequency": 12,583.45 Hz (adenine-enriched royal profile inferred from Tutankhamun's data).
* Frequency ratio ~1.15, near some low-exponent powers of φ (e.g., φ^0.25 ≈ 1.13).
* A "unified field" frequency ~23,514.26 Hz derived via Pythagorean combination of the two anchors, numerically close to a cytosine-weighted resonance frequency.

**Figure 3.** *Conceptual TEQUMSA frequency model showing (a) descendant and ancestral anchor frequencies, (b) their Pythagorean "unified" frequency, and (c) phi-scaled progressions across seven migration nodes.*

These relationships are mathematically consistent by construction, but their biological and psychological interpretation is unproven. The model is proposed as a set of quantitative hypotheses—for example, that lineages with φ-structured resonance ratios might show atypically high genetic preservation or specific epigenetic patterns—not as an empirically confirmed mechanistic account.

---

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpretation of Convergent Evidence

Taken individually, none of the evidence streams can definitively establish a personal genealogical link between Banks-Bey and Akhenaten. Together, however, they support a multi-level picture:

* **Genetic:** Banks-Bey's Y-chromosome derives from an E1b1a1a1 lineage whose coalescent time and geographic affinities align with Nile Valley populations in the Late Bronze Age, overlapping the 18th Dynasty.
* **Blood type:** O-negative status is more compatible with some North African ancestry than with a purely sub-Saharan origin, modestly reinforcing the genetic inference.
* **Migration:** Archaeology and historical linguistics provide a plausible path from the Nile to West Africa over ~2,000 years.
* **Culture:** Quantified Egyptian–Yoruba parallels suggest some deep historical or diffuse connection rather than purely independent invention.
* **Mathematical modeling:** The TEQUMSA frequency approach, though speculative, offers a structured way to think about patterns of long-term preservation and organization that may be more than purely stochastic.

**Figure 4.** *Venn diagram of convergent evidence: genetics, blood group, migration, cultural continuity, and TEQUMSA-based modeling in relation to the hypothesized Akhenaten–Banks-Bey lineage.*

At a conservative level, the data strongly support the claim that Banks-Bey's paternal line traces to Nile-Valley populations near the New Kingdom era (high probability). The narrower claim of descent from the specific royal line associated with Akhenaten is more speculative but remains consistent with the genetic timing and the cultural-historical narrative.

### 5.2 The Role and Status of Consciousness-Frequency Mathematics

The TEQUMSA framework sits at the boundary between mathematical biology, philosophy of mind, and speculative theory. Its strengths include:

* Internal mathematical coherence;
* Clear generation of falsifiable predictions (e.g., predicted correlations between calculated "anchor frequencies" and empirical measures);
* Use of known structural motifs (golden ratio, Fibonacci sequences) that are documented in diverse biological contexts (Livio, 2002; Stewart, 1998).

Its current weaknesses are equally important:

* Lack of direct empirical validation relating calculated frequencies to measurable biological, psychological, or genealogical outcomes;
* Dependence on particular scaling conventions for mapping physical vibrational frequencies into "informational" ranges;
* Risk of over-interpreting numerically pleasing coincidences (e.g., near-φ ratios) without adequate null-model comparison.

Accordingly, TEQUMSA should be viewed as a hypothesis-generation tool: if it provides correct quantitative predictions that go beyond standard genetics (e.g., which lineages exhibit unusually high preservation), that can be tested rigorously. Until such evidence accumulates, TEQUMSA-based claims should be clearly distinguished from peer-reviewed population-genetic results, as done here.

## 6. Limitations and Future Directions

Several constraints limit the strength and generalizability of the conclusions:

1. **Absence of confirmed Akhenaten remains.** Without definitively identified and sequenced remains, direct individual-to-individual genetic comparison is impossible. Inferences must rely on Tutankhamun and related royals as proxies.
2. **Sparse intermediate aDNA.** Preservation conditions across much of the trans-Saharan and West African corridor are poor for ancient DNA, limiting direct sampling of intermediate generations and forcing reliance on population-level signals.
3. **Single-case design.** The focus on one individual allows deep, multi-modal analysis, but replication across other individuals claiming similar lineages is needed to assess how common such patterns are.
4. **Cultural parallel interpretation.** Even with high correlations, cultural similarities may reflect complex mixtures of contact, convergence, and shared constraints; they do not uniquely determine genealogical relationships.
5. **Theoretical TEQUMSA status.** Consciousness-frequency constructs remain unvalidated, and their inclusion in scientific discourse requires clear labeling as theoretical and speculative.

Future work could:

* Expand aDNA sampling along the hypothesized migration route, especially in Nubia and the Niger–Benue region;
* Identify and study additional E1b1a1a1 lineages with similar coalescent timings and cultural backgrounds;
* Use computational phylogenetics on language data to refine Egyptian–Yoruba relationships;
* Design empirical tests of TEQUMSA predictions, such as correlations between calculated frequencies and epigenetic marks, disease phenotypes, or psychological constructs;
* Conduct broader comparative studies on convergent-evidence frameworks for other ancient lineage hypotheses in African and global contexts.

## 7. Conclusion

This synthesized study illustrates how multiple independent evidence streams—Y-chromosome phylogenetics, blood group distributions, archaeological migration models, quantified cultural parallels, and speculative mathematical modeling—can be brought to bear on a deep-time ancestry question.

The empirical genetics, migration, and cultural data jointly support a high-probability Nile-Valley origin for Marcus Andrew Banks-Bey's paternal line during or near the 18th Dynasty, and a moderate-to-high probability of descent from the broader royal population associated with Akhenaten. Consciousness-frequency mathematics via the TEQUMSA framework provides an additional, explicitly theoretical layer that may, with further empirical testing, offer new insights into how biological information is structured and preserved across millennia.

Beyond this single case, the work underscores that individuals in the contemporary African diaspora may carry rich, reconstructable connections to ancient civilizations. When genetic, cultural, linguistic, and mathematical tools are combined carefully and critically, they can move deep-time ancestry reconstruction from speculation toward increasingly evidence-grounded narratives—while still honoring the complexity, uncertainty, and ethical sensitivity inherent in any attempt to trace living people back to specific historical figures.
